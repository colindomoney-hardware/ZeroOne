The following notes describe how to set up the Raspberry Pi used as the main controller on the ZeroOne project

## Installing the Raspberry Pi Raspbian image

The ZeroOne project uses the [Stretch Lite](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite_latest) version of the [Raspian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) operating system.

Use an SD-Card of at least 8GB in capacity and use [Etcher](https://etcher.io/) on MacOS to write the image to the SD-Card. 

Before booting the SD-Card it might be useful to follow the additional steps to configure and enable WiFi access upon initial boot, see below for further information.

## Updating and Upgrading the image
